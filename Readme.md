Overview
This project involves creating a PetaLinux-based operating system for the Xilinx KRIA KR260 board and developing an embedded software application. The application will consist of three threads:

1. Capture Packets: Captures Ethernet packets.
2. Process Packets: Processes the captured packets (e.g., compression or other algorithms).
3. Send Packets: Sends the processed packets.
